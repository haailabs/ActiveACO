1. Perform a comprehensive sweep over various node sizes and the number of graphs to compare the three optimization methods (Nearest Neighbor TSP, Basic ACO, and AI ACO).

2. Generate and include visualizations to illustrate the results of the comparisons.

3. Update the README.md file to include a detailed report section that explains the results and the implementation details of the optimization methods.

4. Investigate and document how different types of graphs impact the performance of the algorithms.
